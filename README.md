For local build

```./make_tests.sh``` should be enough to run the tests. If you want to see code coverage, create a folder or change the location in the script file ```run_code_coverage``` and should be ok.



Some notes:

Reminder that src/CMakeLists.txt has --coverage added on > add option for testing.

plugin.c has +1, +2 added on

check log files have log files...

TODO:

Add docs for testing - how tests work etc
